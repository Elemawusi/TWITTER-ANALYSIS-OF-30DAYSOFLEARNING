RECOMMENDATION
1. More resources should be channelled towards creating awareness of the next batch of the program in campus groups in order to engage more of the target population, being students and the youth. 
2. Incentives can be given to the top 3 active users to engage more users to tweet about the program. This will increase the visibility of the program as well as serve as a means of unpaid advertising through word of mouth from these rewarded users.
3. Reactor classes should be channeled between Wednesdays to Fridays, being the days of most active tweets. Meanwhile, the other days could be converted into discussion and problem solving days on projects of the week. This will encourage more people to participate on the weekends.
